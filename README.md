## About

Indooroopilly Shopping Centre parking voucher barcodes appear to be fairly predictable. Visiting this project's [GitHub page](https://eidorb.github.io/indro-parking/) generates barcodes of a similar style.

Today's date along with a random transaction number are encoded as a [Code 39](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_39) barcode.
